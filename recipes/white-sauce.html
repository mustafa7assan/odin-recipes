    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This white sauce recipe can be used as a base for many dishes, such as
      lasagna and chicken pot pie. I use it to make macaroni and cheese for my
      granddaughter. I learned to make it in home economics too many years ago
      to count!

        minutes.
